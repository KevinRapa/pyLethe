"Note to self- a Book On Note Therapy"
With the constant burden of responsibility today- milking the cow, witch reporting, bringing out your dead- many of us feel as though we are forgetting something all the time in this modern way of life. Constantly now it seems the courier visits the village to deliver more news. The amount of information traded today is incredible. However, think of those letters and documents the courier carries. He doesn't remember what's on them, that's what the paper is for!

The village oaf can write on parchment with ink and understand their own words. To the commoner, writing notes to oneself may be a source of embarrassment. "Who in their own mind need they write to? They have their own brain, correct?" Writing momentos to one's self may seem akin to something disturbing like self-conversation. Think, however, how much less information would be bouncing wantonly in your head if you allowed the paper to hold it for you?

If you feel forgetful, in a casual dementia, or even short of IQ, I encourage you leave notes around for yourself. You may then find your mind easing from the removal of the weight of remembering.
