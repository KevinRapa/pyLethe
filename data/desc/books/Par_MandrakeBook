"The Care of Mandragora"

Mandragora, modernized as mandrake, is a genus of root. In stories these are described as sentient creatures remembling roots that are grown, though this is fictional. Mandrakes are delicate and prefer to be grown by themselves in a single pot filled with fertile soil. Any medium pot should suffice though. Mandrakes prefer well-drained soil, so watering is only necessary every few days.

To begin growing your mandrake, simply mix together some soil, sand, and fertilizer. The sand is important to keep the mixture aerated. Fill a pot with the mixture, leaving about an inch of clearance. Then, rest the juvenile mandragora in the pot just under the surface. From there, all that's needed is some initial watering, and the rain will do the rest. Just make sure to leave it outside. Within a month, your mandragora should be fully mature. Mandragora are known to have a very pleasant taste when cooked. Mandragora are also used in certain alchemical and enchanting recipes, but that is beyond the scope of this book.
