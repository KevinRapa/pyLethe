GAL6
The weird apparatus looks like a metal platform with three curved arms projecting out and over the top of itself. Wires run all over the thing, and lights on it go *bleep bleep bleep*. The machine emits some sort of blue light. Next to the apparatus is a label that reads: "Plasma induction charger".
The device appears to be powered by some invisible source and lacks an off switch.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You look on the platform.
