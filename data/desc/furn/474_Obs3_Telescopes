The telescopes have many different copper parts and intricate carvings. One of them is pointed at the lighthouse along the cliff in the distance.
You gaze through the telescope pointed at the lighthouse. As the beacon rotates in your direction, the blinding glare forces your eye away.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
They look like just plain telescopes. Expensive though.
