GAL6
This thing looks complicated. It's black, and... it has some kind of big ball for a body. And it's metal. Yeah, you're sure that's metal. It has a long barrel coming out the front with slots in it and the whole thing is covered in lights and wires. Wait... there's an empty square compartment on top. What is that for?
You have no idea how this thing works.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You search around the futuristic cannon.
