MHA3
The chair's frame is glorious rosewood. What you wouldn't give to chop down a towering Dalbergia. Its cushioning is a dark green diamond pattern which you don't care for.
You sit down in the chair, noting its marvelous polish.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You look underneath but find nothing.
