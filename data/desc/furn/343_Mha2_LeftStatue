MHA2
The angel poses majestically with an indifferent gaze upwards. It holds a silver spear in its hand and points it upwards over the right angel. In its hollow base is an open compartment.
Such an impressive work of artistry deserves not to be tainted by your touch.
You start jamming it into the angel's hand before realizing that the angel is already holding a spear.
You look into the compartment inside its base.
