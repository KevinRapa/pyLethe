VEST
An round, ornate, wooden end table. A ceramic case rests on top.
Jostling the table a little, you find its craftsmanship impressive. The carvings on it are equally such.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
The table does not seem to be hiding anything. The case on top looks tempting, however.
