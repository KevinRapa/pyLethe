TM32
The casket is just a decrepit wooden box with a couple hinges on one side. Its ominous, solemn presence in the forgotten chamber gives off a sinister vibe.
What a morbid thought... are you not cozy enough in this room?
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You slowly swing open the casket lid. There is nobody inside. You look at the bottom of the casket.
