CHA1
The cylix resembles a wide brass bowl decorated with many angular etchings.
The cylix isn't portable enough to simply take.
You begin banging the container against the bowl, but the bowl isn't fitting inside...
If your logic holds as well as this bowl holds water, you'd guess this vessel was filled with the holy kind. You can't pick up the water with your hands though.
