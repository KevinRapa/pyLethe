BHA3
The wood-plank floor bends with the hallway. The planks bend with it without prying up. Could this all be an illusion?
You jam the spade into the floor. Your body jolts and you stagger back. The floor is undefeated.
There's no reason to stand the ladder up in here.
You crouch down and scan the ground.
