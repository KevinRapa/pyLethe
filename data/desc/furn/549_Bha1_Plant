BHA3
The plant doesn't seem to be in good shape. Though drooping a bit, it's still alive.
You pour a bit of the water on the plant. The plant trembles some and a bit of life springs back into it. 
Pouring that on the plant is definitely not going to be good for it, you monster.
You fan through the soil.
