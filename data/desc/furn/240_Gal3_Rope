GAL3
The rope is tied to the ladder and hoists it up with a pulley. It feeds into a hole in the wall next to you. Above the hole, you see a switch.
You cut the rope. The ladder drops down into the room, giving access to the loft.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
It's just an ordinary rope.
