GAR2
You peer over the thick granite railing into the hole. To your surprise, it's the rotunda you were in earlier! It's about a 25 foot drop down.
The drop is too great. It's about 25 feet down. You'd surely break something.
You tie the end of the hose to the railing and throw it over the edge. Hopefully it will support your weight.
