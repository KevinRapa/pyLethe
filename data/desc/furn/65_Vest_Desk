VEST
A tenuous wooden desk, resting flush against a dark corner. It collects dust from a lack of use. On it rests a strange, neglected glass orb. A single drawer is visible under its surface.
You give the desk a small kick. Though creaky and old, it's a good desk. Perhaps if you weren't trapped here, you'd take it home with you.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You slide open the drawer and peer inside.
