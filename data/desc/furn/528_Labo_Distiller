LABO
It's one half of a larger alchemical contraption in the room. On the table is a metal flask rack and a bunsen burner under it. Above the setup is a curved glass tube connecting it to the condenser on the other side of the table.
There doesn't seem to be much to work on with your hands. You will need some tools to interact with self.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
The contraption is comprised of many alchemical components. Though they're alien to you, you note nothing out of the ordinary.
