ROTU
The cloaked statues gloom over you with angry stares. Perhaps they were happier at one point when this room was cleaner? Surely any normal person would be opposed to keeping such sinister objects in their home.
You feel the statue, but you feel discomforted in thinking that somehow, the other statues may be watching you.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You look around the statue but find nothing of interest.
