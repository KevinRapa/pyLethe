The small machine rests % and appears to be a short black metal box, waist-high, with a front door and handle. The front and top are metal, but the sides are rubber. &
With bear-like strength, you push against the heavy machine and succeed in moving it a small amount. A plugged-in outlet reveals itself behind the machine.
Hitting the machine only sends a sharp current of electricity through your body.
As you touch the front handle, a strong electrical current propels up your arm. You yank your hand back.
