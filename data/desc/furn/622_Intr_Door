INTR
The metal door offers a view to the outside through a small barred opening. You can see into a larger room with a pool in the center. A vortex of water in the pool spins a water wheel attached to a driveshaft going into the ceiling. You can see a door on the far opposite side and a small black grate in the room's corner. You can't locate the source of the discomforting noise though.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
...Do you intend to pick the lock with that? Well, perhaps you could, but then again, you are not learned of this skill. Yet another you yearn for at the moment.
You aren't sure what you'd search for on a door.
