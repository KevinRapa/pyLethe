GAL4
The floor here is checkered gray and tan in a smooth rock. Running along the floor around the balcony is a royal blue carpet-runner.
You jam the spade into the floor. Your body jolts and you stagger back. The floor is undefeated.
There's no reason to stand the ladder up in here.
You crouch down and scan the ground.
