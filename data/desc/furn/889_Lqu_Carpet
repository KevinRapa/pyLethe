LQU2
The lavender carpet covers much of the cold floor.
You take some valuable time to admire the carpet. Yes, what a wonderfully woven piece of artwork. It really would be a shame to get self.dirty. What a fantastic rug.
That would most certainly ruin it.
There's nothing interesting under the carpet.
