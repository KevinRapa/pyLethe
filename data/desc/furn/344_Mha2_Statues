The pair of statues are mirror images of each other. Each leans toward the other while gazing nonchalantly towards the ceiling. The only differences are that the left statue holds a spear while the right one does not and the left statue's base is hollow with an open compartment inside. Choose a specific statue by specifying 'left statue' or 'right statue'.
Such impressive works of artistry deserve not to be tainted by your touch.
