GAL4
The mounted metal case is padlocked shut and currently protecting a large painting of a woman posing to the left in a chair. She has long brown hair and pale, perfect skin, as well as a slight grin. Interesting, as you note that she also lacks eyebrows.
You jam every key you can into the padlock, but nothing fits.
The glass front is clearly designed to keep dimwits like you out.
The case is locked shut, and you cannot pry it open.
