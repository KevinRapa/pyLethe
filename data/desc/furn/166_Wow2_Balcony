WOW2
You can't see much from down here. The balcony is small and crowded. You can see a door up there against the east wall. You also spot what appears to be a rope on a shelf.
That doesn't seem like a safe thing to do...
You lean the ladder against the balcony. It's just tall enough.
The entire balcony? One thing at a time please.
