SOUL
The pool of aether swirls with white... stuff, and gently bubbles. The blue liquid inside is opaque, but can't be more than a couple feet deep.
You leap into the pool and die. The end. Oh, the tragedy, having made it this far only to make such a stupid decision. That's how it would have been if you'd have actually jumped.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You just find a bunch of aether.
