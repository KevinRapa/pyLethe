INTR
Many gears and axles of different sizes spin on the walls. They must generate power for something.
You don't think sticking your hand in there is a good idea.
You thrust the bar into the gears. The bar bounces off, ineffective. Your body jolts back.
You search around the machinery but cannot find anything useful.
