CRY1
The tall statue stands in the center of this side of the room. The statue is cloaked with a skull for a head and stares at you. It holds one of its boney hands up as if it were grasping something, though its palm is empty. With the other palm it reaches out openly towards you.
You brush your hand against the statue and marvel at its detail.
You place the scythe into the statue's left hand.
You look around the statue but find nothing of interest.
