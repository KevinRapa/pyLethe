CEL5
The thick grate is about two and a half feet across and covers what you can only assume to be the top rung of a ladder. The grate looks just light enough to lift, however the grate is locked down with a padlock.
You can almost lift it, but a rogue padlock is sabotaging your attempt.
A sharp vibration propels through your body from the impact. Quite an impulse and futile decision.
All that is of interest is a padlock and the metal rung below the grate.
