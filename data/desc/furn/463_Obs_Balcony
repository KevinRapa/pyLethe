OBS3
One balcony to the east on the second level serves as the sole access point to the third floor. The third floor balcony starts at the northeast and curves around the west side of the room against the window.
That doesn't seem like a safe thing to do...
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
The entire balcony? One thing at a time please.
