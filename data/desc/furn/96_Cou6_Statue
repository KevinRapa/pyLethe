The statue is just a waist with legs. Part of it lies on the ground. It once depicted a male figure.
The statue is rough and weathered- cracked all over from the variable weather it has endured for likely a while.
You balance the % the best you can on the pair of legs, but can only watch helplessly as it falls back off onto the ground.
You look around the statue but find nothing of interest.
