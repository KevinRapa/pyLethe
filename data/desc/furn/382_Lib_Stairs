LIB3
The stairs are a gray stone with salmon-colored marble steps. They lead up to the northern second-floor area of the library.
You successfully climb the stairs to the second floor.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You begin the search, but as soon as you touch the stairs, they flatten down to the floor before popping back up again.
