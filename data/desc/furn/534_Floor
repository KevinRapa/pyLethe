LABO
It's a black and white checkered tile. A predictable floor for a laboratory. A few burn marks taint the floor just at the foot of the counter to the north.
You jam the spade into the floor. Your body jolts and you stagger back. The floor is undefeated.
There's no reason to stand the ladder up in here.
You crouch down and scan the ground.
