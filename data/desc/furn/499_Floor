PAR1
It's a sandstone tiled floor, much like that in the west wing. The floor here does appear noticeably cleaner and more refined, however.
You jam the spade into the floor. Your body jolts and you stagger back. The floor is undefeated.
There's no reason to stand the ladder up in here.
You crouch down and scan the ground.
