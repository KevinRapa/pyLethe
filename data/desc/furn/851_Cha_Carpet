CHA2
The long red carpet runs in between the pews. Small puffs of smoke rise up with each step you take on it.
You take some valuable time to admire the carpet. Yes, what a wonderfully woven piece of artwork. It really would be a shame to get self.dirty. What a fantastic rug.
That would most certainly ruin it.
There's nothing interesting under the carpet.
