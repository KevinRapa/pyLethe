Passed the iron gate, you can see the tunnel leading further down into darkness. The iron bars extend down into the water where they form a grate of sorts, you suppose to prevent things from... escaping unwantedly.
You can't get the gate open. It's locked.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
They're just iron bars.
