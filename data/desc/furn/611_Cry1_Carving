CRY1
Carved into the wall is a mural of sorts. In the center is a standing cloaked figure resembling a skeleton. It holds a scythe and stands elevated among many unclothed people piled up onto each other crawling towards it, perhaps wishing to embrace the figure. Many clouds gather high above the skeleton.
Something so morbid hardly seems admirable...
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
There's nothing hiding here.
