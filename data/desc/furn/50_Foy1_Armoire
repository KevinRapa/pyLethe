FOY1
The clean lavender armoire stands on four stubby legs near the south corner of the foyer. Double doors on its front conceal possibly endless riches hidden inside.
The armoire moves a tad from your kick. A light screech echos from the feet rubbing against the stone floor.
Are we feeling bloodthirsty? Or perhaps you didn't realize that the armoire is unlocked?
You open up the armoire and look inside.
