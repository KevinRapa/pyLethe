GAR3
It's a wooden chest for the holding of gardening, and other nonsense. This one has a rather large keyhole.
It takes a small bit of force, but the rusty key manages to open the chest.
An ingenious idea. The player manages to break the lock using the drill with a swift jab into the keyhole.
To your dismay, the chest has been locked previously.
