It's a large wooden double-door cabinet. It looks plain and cheap. It must just house tools for the servants.
The tiny metal key fits perfectly. You turn it and the cabinet makes a satisfying *click*.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
The cabinet is locked. Maybe one of the servants had a key...
