TORC
The large wooden wheel is about 6 feet in diameter. The wheel has many small nicks and gashes on its surface, and many pegs stick out towards you around its edge. It is suspended from a stand and looks rotatable.
You give the wheel a spin. It squeaks as it turns and quiets down slowly as the wheel comes to a halt.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You look behind the wheel.
