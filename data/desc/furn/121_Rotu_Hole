ROTU
It's a hole carved in the ceiling, about a meter wide. It looks to lead outside to the roof, although there's a glass encasing around the space above.
The hole is high up in the ceiling. How would you go about that? Especially with your heft. Few ropes could support such weight.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
The hole is but empty space. You have nothing to search.
