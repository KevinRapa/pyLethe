PRIS
The apparition resembles a middle-aged bald male with a long beard. his eyes are blank, and he sits passively in the corner. He looks at you funny. "Do you have a habit of staring?" He asks.
"Now that I have my watch, I do not have any more reason to stay. I suppose I will find peace somewhere else in a little while."
You really aren't a natural killer...
The ghost looks to not have anything interesting.
