GAL4
An luxurious looking rug, as are the rest in this castle. Woven into the rug along the edges are fine golden meandering designs.
You take some valuable time to admire the carpet. Yes, what a wonderfully woven piece of artwork. It really would be a shame to get self.dirty. What a fantastic rug.
That would most certainly ruin it.
You walk along the balcony, scanning the carpet for irregularities and lifting it every now and then. You can't seem to find anything of interest.
