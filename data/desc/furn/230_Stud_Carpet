STUD
A thick red carpet. On top sits the writing desk and chair.
You take some valuable time to admire the carpet. Yes, what a wonderfully woven piece of artwork. It really would be a shame to get self.dirty. What a fantastic rug.
That would most certainly ruin it.
To your great curiosity, lifting up the carpet reveals a second identical carpet underneath.
