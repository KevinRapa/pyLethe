CRY2
The tall coffin resembles a large stone box with a lid, but something is holding it closed. The lid of the coffin is artfully decorated with a carving of a boney cloaked figure wearing a halo. Around it is an engraving resembling a doorway. The engraving depicts two grooved columns holding up a roof.
You can't pry it open. Something is holding the coffin tightly closed.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
There's nothing hiding here.
