LIB1
The artifact is a stone head with a hollowed out cranium. It's carved crudely. The face is eerily expressionless and its eyes are blank. It seems ancient. % shoots out a hole in the top, reflecting off the ceiling mirror onto the desk. You look around, but the head isn't connected to anything. You can't determine the light's source.
The large stone head is too heavy to pick up.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You squint and peek inside the head.
