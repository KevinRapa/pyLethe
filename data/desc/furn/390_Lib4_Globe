OBS1
The globe looks antique, but on a closer look, it seems fairly modern. Early 1920s you guess.
You think to yourself, 'when I get out of here, I'd like to stay this adventurous but be three times as safe.' You spin the globe and blindly stop it on a country, intending to take take a well-earned vacation after this ordeal is through. You stop on the Soviet Union. 'Well, maybe I'll wait a few years for all that nonsense to end over there'.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
There's nothing hiding here.
