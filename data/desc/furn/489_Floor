GAR4
The floor out here is made of large shale slabs. It's a miracle this castle's architecture can hold this area up.
You jam the spade into the floor. Your body jolts and you stagger back. The floor is undefeated.
There's no reason to stand the ladder up in here.
You crouch down and scan the ground.
