SQUA
A plain wooden desk, resting flush against the wall. On top is a small lit candle.
You give the desk a small kick. 'It's a good desk...' you think to yourself. It's definitely not as impressive as that desk in the vestibule, though.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You slide open the drawer and peer inside.
