The three robed males tower over you. Each bears in his hand what looks like an archaic key. The first male is bearded and wears a crown made of grass. The second is clean-shaven and holds a scepter. He wears the hat of a scholar. The third looks old and has a demonic presence to him. He holds a candelabra and wears an ostensibly metal crown.
You brush your hand against the statue and marvel at its detail.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
The keys are just part of the statue.
