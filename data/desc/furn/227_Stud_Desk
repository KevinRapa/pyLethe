STUD
A fancy desk with curved legs. Its glossy surface reflects the glow of the fireplace. 
You give the desk a small kick. Though creaky and old, it's a good desk. Perhaps if you weren't trapped here, you'd take it home with you.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You slide open the drawer and peer inside.
