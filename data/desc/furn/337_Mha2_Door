The double doors here are locked tight. Four round sockets are built into the door's surface. One already contains a gold disk with an engraving of an angel on it. In the other three sockets you make out a second engraving of an angel, an engraving of a soldier, and an engraving of a horse.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
...Do you intend to pick the lock with that? Well, perhaps you could, but then again, you are not learned of this skill. Yet another you yearn for at the moment.
You aren't sure what you'd search for on a door.
