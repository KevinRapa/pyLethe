Scattered around the prison are several standing candelabras. Each one is rusted, the candles are heavily melted, and dried wax is seen dirtying every light. Still, the candles continue to burn.
That does not cause anything interesting.
The torch is already lit, despite having been kept in your pocket self.whole time.
The candelabra holds some candles.
