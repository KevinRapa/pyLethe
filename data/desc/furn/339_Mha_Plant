MHA2
The potted plant is in okay shape, but could afford a bit more care. It sits in a fancy white vase.
You pour a bit of the water on the plant. The plant trembles some and a bit of life springs back into it. 
Pouring that on the plant is definitely not going to be good for it, you monster.
You fan through the soil.
