OBS1
The large old heavy telescope sits as an antique against the west wall. It looks to be made of mostly aluminum, bronze, and wood. A small eyepiece connects to a 1 foot-wide lens near the top. Many various gears and other parts comprise it as well.
You look into the eyepiece and see nothing but black.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You carefully look through its various intricacies.
