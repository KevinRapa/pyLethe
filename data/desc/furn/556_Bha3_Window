You peer out the window and see an expanse of ocean meeting the foot of the cliff on which the castle rests. You puzzle at the fact, thinking you were much farther from the castle at this point.
This is a plain window. It has no moving parts.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
There's nothing hiding here.
