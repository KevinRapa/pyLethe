SEW5
The river is about 11 feet across and 5 feet deep. It flows through an artificial square channel constructed into the floor. The water looks clear and smells quite clean. You imagine that it was a natural stream at some point before being built around. The river flows down the tunnel eastwards with quite a strong current. 
The water is treacherous and not worth the risk.
You scoop up some of the water into the bucket.
You crouch down and scan the bottom of the river.
