The metal valve is connected to a console mounted on the wall next to the door. A smaller pipe coming out the top of the console connects to the larger pipe running through the wall above the door.
With all your strength, you manage to turn the valve.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
There's nothing hiding here.
