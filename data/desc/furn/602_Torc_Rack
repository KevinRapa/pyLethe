TORC
It's a plain wooden table, about 8 feet long, with no intricacies. At one end of the table is a roller of sorts with a crank on one side and a couple ropes tied around it. Along the table are several long leather straps and buckles. At the opposite end are two more short ropes.
The macabre idea of laying on the table dances in your head. You let off a sarcastic chuckle and try to forget about it.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You look on the table.
