TM66
The casket is just a decrepit wooden box with a couple hinges on one side. Its ominous, solemn presence in the forgotten chamber gives off a sinister vibe.
What a morbid thought... are you not cozy enough in this room?
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You slowly swing open the casket lid. A faint, musty odor escapes. Though not unexpected, you are surprised to see a preserved, but degenerate body standing limp in the casket on several layers of fabric. The body is emaciated and wrinkled, but you can still make out its features, including the eyes. The body is dressed in blue robes, probably a luxury during its time. A silky braided rope is tied around the robe at the waist. It wears the hat of a scholar or academic and holds its hands cupped at the waist. You look in its hands.
