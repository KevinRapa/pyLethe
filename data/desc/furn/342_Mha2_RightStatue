MHA2
The angel poses majestically with an indifferent gaze upwards. It's a mirror-image of the left statue, though its hand is empty.
Such an impressive work of artistry deserves not to be tainted by your touch.
You slide the spear back into the angel's grasp. The divines will be pleased with you. A compartment reveals itself at the statue's base.
There looks to be no compartment on this one.
