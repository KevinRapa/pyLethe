PAR1
A dusty Persian rug. Clearly an antique, but it looks surprisingly new.
You take some valuable time to admire the carpet. Yes, what a wonderfully woven piece of artwork. It really would be a shame to get self.dirty. What a fantastic rug.
That would most certainly ruin it.
To your great curiosity, lifting up the rug reveals a second identical rug underneath.
