GAL1
The four-paneled Japanese screen sits in the corner of the room. A panorama is hand-drawn on it. Its delicate black lines depict a mountain front landscape.
You slide the screen out of the way some, revealing a large black lever mounted to the floor.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
The light shining through this screen forms an odd silhouette on its surface.
