MHA3
The silver chandelier hangs many feet above you. Its intricacy gives it a classical feel, unlike the black iron one in the foyer. It holds many candles at least twenty. 'Who keeps these lit?' You think to yourself.
That would not be a very civilized thing to do.
The chandelier is lit already.
You are pretty sure you can't jump that high.
