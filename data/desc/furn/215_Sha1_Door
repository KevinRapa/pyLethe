It's a small wooden door a bit taller than you. The doorknob on it is missing.
The doorknob is gone!!
You give the door a good bang with the ram. It gives from its hinges and falls to the floor. But the frayed rope you're holding the ram with snaps in half. Good thing that worked on the first try.
You aren't sure what you'd search for on a door.
