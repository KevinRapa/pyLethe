GAL3
In the corner of the room stands this odd statue. It resembles a human, but barely. All you can make out are two shoulders and a deformed face with no features apart from a couple ears.
You brush your hand against the statue and marvel at its detail.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You look around the statue but find nothing of interest.
