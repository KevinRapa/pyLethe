GAL1
The hanging scroll is ink drawn in black on an orange-stained parchment. It depicts a few scraggly trees in front of a mountain range. At the top, something is written in a foreign language. The light is hitting this piece strangely.
Upon lifting the scroll from the wall, you discover a hollow containing a dome-shaped button.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
There is something odd about the light hitting this scroll.
