GAL6
The machine is a tall metal box with a bunch of dials, wires, and lights. Some wires feed out the back directly into the wall. Above, an extension resembling a shower head comes out the top of the machine. Oh, what's this? There's a single button on the front. Better not press that...
Turning the dials does... nothing at all it seems.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
Everything on the machine looks attached and not removable.
