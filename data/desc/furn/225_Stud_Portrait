The portrait depicts a bald male with round glasses, maybe fifty years old. He looks a bit like an angry Bob Gunton. 'Could this be a picture of Eurynomos?' you say to yourself. 'Wait, who's Bob Gunton?' you ask, but you hear no answer. With the light cast from the fireplace, it seems like this picture is not resting flush on the wall.
You lift up the portrait resembling Bob Gunton, appropriately revealing a safe.
You can't bring yourself to destroy such an expensive object.
There's nothing on this picture. Interestingly, the portrait does not rest flush on the wall.
