FOY2
A white marble statue. It depicts a woman holding a vessel of water on her shoulder. At its base, there appears to be some skid markings on the floor.
You brush your hand against the statue and marvel at its detail.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
The statue appears to hide nothing, although, you can see streaks on the floor beginning at the statue's base.
