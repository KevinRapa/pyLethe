The rusty metal pipe runs out the top of the console on the south wall, along the ceiling to the north side of the room, and along the length of the tunnel westward.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
There's nothing missing from the pipe in this area!
It doesn't seem to be hiding anything.
