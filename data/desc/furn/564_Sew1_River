SEW1
The river is about 11 feet across and 5 feet deep. It flows through an artificial square trench constructed into the floor. The water looks clear and smells quite clean. You imagine that it was a natural spring at some point before being built around. It flows briskly and terminates here at a metal grate.
The water is treacherous and not worth the risk.
You scoop up some of the water into the bucket.
You crouch down and scan the bottom of the river.
