GAL6
The metal helmet is covered in wires and metal rods. On the inside are three metal contact plates. It would not be a good idea to wear self.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! With all your strength, you rip the helmet off your head. It takes you a few moments to catch your breath and recover your sense of direction. You cannot comprehend what just happened.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
Everything on the helmet looks concretely attached to the helmet and not removable.
