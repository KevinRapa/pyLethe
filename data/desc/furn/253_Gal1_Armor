GAL1
You know a set of samurai armor when you see one. This set is mostly black and brown with gold plating on the helmet. Not as colorful as what you've seen before, but this must be the functional kind.
You will probably get hurt trying to do that.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
You find many little intricate parts to this piece, but nothing removable.
