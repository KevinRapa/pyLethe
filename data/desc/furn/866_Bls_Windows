The atrium is glassed in from floor to ceiling. To the west, you can see the rooftop garden from which you escaped the parlor. To the north, you see a terminal room higher up in the castle supported by a large pillar. The moon begins to fade and a small amount of light brightens the sky.
This is a plain window. It has no moving parts.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
There's nothing hiding here.
