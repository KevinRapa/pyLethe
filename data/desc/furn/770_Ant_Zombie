AN65
The hideous dessicated figure is eyeless and frail. It just stands there in the corner of the room, pointing its face at you with its mouth hanging open. It is clothed in simple farming vestments and keeps one of its hands in its pocket. 'Is it alive?' You wonder to yourself.
The figure makes a loud moan. You jump, and every hair on your body stands. The zombie takes the brain in a jar from you and manages to stuff it in its small pocket. The figure pulls its hand out and offers you a small boxy object. The figure makes another load moan and holds its hand out. You take the item. The figure makes a final loud moan and remains quiet.
The zombie-like body, though horrific, appears passive. You aren't very inclined to attack it.
You aren't nearly sly enough for that.
