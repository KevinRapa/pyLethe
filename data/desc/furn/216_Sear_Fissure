COUS
The north wall has been damaged, and a resulting fissure in it leads outside through the wall into the front courtyard. Seems this was part of an escape plan.
You couldn't manage to do that with your bare hands.
The wall gives way from the swing of the heavy warhammer, which snaps in half. You begin to think the wood ax is the only tool you know how to use without breaking.
It's just an empty hole.
