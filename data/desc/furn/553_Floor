BHA2
The floor has changed. Most of the wood planks have been removed revealing a dirt-like ground below... But it's not dirt.
You jam the spade into the floor. Your body jolts and you stagger back. The floor is undefeated.
There's no reason to stand the ladder up in here.
You crouch down and scan the ground.
