SOUL
The stained glass window depicts a grim image. An old wizard, it seems, looms over an ostensibly dying person. The persons mouth is open, and a bluish stream leaves the mouth and enters the wizard's mouth.
This is a plain window. It has no moving parts.
An interesting but far-fetched proposition.
There's nothing hiding here.
