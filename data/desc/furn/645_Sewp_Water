The water circles rapidly around the pool turning the wheel in the center. The driveshaft must be powering something. The water drains down a hole at the pool's bottom.
It's probably not a good idea to step near that pool.
You dip the bucket in and fill it with water.
Anything that fell in there is long gone at this point.
