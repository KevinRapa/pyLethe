JHA1
It's a menacing jade statue of a lion. A sparkling ruby sits in one of its eye sockets. The other socket is empty. Strange that someone decided to display them way back here where no one can see them. 
You brush your hand against the statue and marvel at its detail.
You place the ruby into the lion's eye socket. The ruby glints and stays in place.
There don't seem to be any secret compartments on this statue. Although, one of the rubies sitting in its eye sockets has gone missing.
