The elderly woman sits on the floor in a corner garbed in black robes which cover all her body save her face. She keeps her unsettling glare on you and laughs quietly to herself.
*A deranged laugh* "We all forget, so why measure oneself with impalpable knowledge when we have our wealth???? Eury does not know my secret!!! All his riches can be mine at my pleasure!!!! Hell treats the wealthy comfortably and the wise with contempt!!!!"
You really aren't a natural killer...
Approaching her seems like a dangerous thing to do.
